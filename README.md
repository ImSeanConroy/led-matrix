# LED Matrix

This project is a minimal, compact 12-pixel (2 rows Ã— 6 columns) WS2812D-based LED matrix, created using KiCad.

## Components

The following are the required components to build the 2x6 LED Matrix:

1. WS2812D 8mm LEDs - [AliExpress](https://aliexpress.bitluni.net/ws2812d)
2. 2x03 Pin Headers - [AliExpress](https://aliexpress.bitluni.net/ws2812d)

## Getting Started

1. Open the `.kicad_pro` file in KiCad.
2. Review the schematic and PCB layout.
3. Export Gerbers or modify the design as needed.
4. Order PCBs from your preferred manufacturer.
5. Solder components following the BOM.
6. Connect to a compatible microcontroller and use any WS2812-compatible library (e.g., Adafruit NeoPixel, FastLED).
