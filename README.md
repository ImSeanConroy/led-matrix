# LED Matrix

This project is a minimal, compact 12-pixel LED matrix (2 rows Ã— 6 columns), based on WS2812D addressable LEDs and created using KiCad.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Project** - Open the .kicad_pro file in KiCad to view the project.
2. **Review the Design** - Inspect the schematic and PCB layout to ensure it meets your needs.
3. **Customize or Export** - Make any modifications and export the Gerber files for fabrication.
4. **Order the PCB** - Submit the Gerber files to your preferred PCB manufacturer.
5. **Get components** - Purchase the components from the BOM and a compatible board.
6. **Assemble the Hardware** - Solder the components and assemble the board.
7. **Upload the Firmware** - Connect the board via USB and upload the firmware.

## Required Components

The following are the required components to build the 2x6 LED Matrix:

1. WS2812D 8mm LEDs - [AliExpress](https://aliexpress.bitluni.net/ws2812d)
2. 2x03 Pin Headers - [AliExpress](https://aliexpress.bitluni.net/ws2812d)
